# steam-thcrap
This is a small program to automatically add [thcrap](https://thpatch.net)-patched Touhou games to Steam as shortcuts ("Non-Steam Games").
It was created due to the fact that adding them manually these days can take a damn hour or so since there's tons of games and Steam's built-in shortcut editor is wildly inefficient for adding multiple games with custom launch arguments.

## Usage instructions
[Download](../../releases/latest/download/steam-thcrap.zip) the latest release, extract and place the `steam-thcrap` folder near `thcrap.exe`, and run the `steam-thcrap.exe` file inside. Follow on-screen prompts, and restart Steam when the app tells you to do so.
